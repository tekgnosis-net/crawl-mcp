## Chat transcript â€” 2025-09-22

Summary:
- Topic: CI fixes, GitHub Actions multi-arch Docker builds, docker-compose runtime issue (exec format error).
- Key actions performed: fixed flake8/pytest issues, updated Dockerfile and GH Actions workflow to build and push multi-arch images, triggered CI runs, inspected published manifests, diagnosed container runtime error locally.

Important diagnostics captured:
- Verified image `/usr/local/bin/python` is a symlink to `/usr/local/bin/python3.11` and `python3.11 -V` reports `Python 3.11.13` when executed inside an arm64 container.
- Manifest for SHA-tag contains both `amd64` and `arm64` platform entries.
- Local `docker image inspect` showed `Architecture=arm64` for `ghcr.io/tekgnosis-net/crawl-mcp:latest` during diagnostics.

Recommended save location: commit this file into the repo under `docs/chat-history/` so future sessions can reference it.

Full transcript (abridged):
- User reported CI failures (flake8/pytest) and asked to reproduce and fix them locally. Assistant made minimal safe fixes and added a smoke test.
- CI build-and-push initially failed due to Dockerfile apt-key and package issues; Dockerfile and workflow were updated and the build succeeded, publishing multi-arch images.
- User saw `exec /usr/local/bin/python: exec format error` when starting the container via docker-compose. Assistant ran diagnostics:
  - `docker image inspect` showed `Architecture=arm64` for the local image.
  - `docker manifest inspect` confirmed multi-arch manifests were published.
  - `docker run --platform linux/arm64` into the image, printed `/usr/local/bin` contents and confirmed `python3.11` exists and runs.
  - After removing and re-pulling the local image, `python3.11 -V` executed successfully inside an arm64 container.

Next steps recommended:
- Refresh local image and restart docker-compose to ensure Docker pulls the correct platform image.
- If the error persists, inspect inside the running container (shell) to check for broken symlinks; consider changing compose to call `python3.11` explicitly or patch the Dockerfile to create a stable `/usr/local/bin/python` symlink and rebuild.
