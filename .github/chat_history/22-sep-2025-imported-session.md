## Summary (high level)

- Problem investigated: `docker compose up` produced an "exec format error" when starting the container on an amd64 host. The image pulled was built for linux/arm64.
- Actions taken:
  - Pulled remote repo updates and imported `.github/chat_history/22-sep-2025-macos.md`.
  - Edited `docker-compose.yml` to: set a default `platform: linux/amd64`, add an optional `build` context, and later cleaned environment entries and quoting for CHROME_FLAGS.
  - Fixed YAML indentation and removed Markdown fences that caused parsing errors.
  - Rebuilt the image locally using `docker compose build` (via `docker compose up --build`) so the image matches the host architecture.
  - Verified `python -V` inside the built image succeeded and ran an import test of `crawl4ai_mcp.server`.
  - Attempted to run the server in HTTP mode; observed a runtime error (`FastMCP.run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'host'`) which indicates the FastMCP API call in `server.py` expects different parameters; further investigation of that specific FastMCP invocation is recommended.

## Files changed (working tree)
- `.github/chat_history/22-sep-2025-imported-session.md` (this file)
- `docker-compose.yml` (edited: platform/default build, environment mapping for CHROME_FLAGS, CMD-SHELL healthcheck, removed markdown fences and fixed quoting/indentation)

Note: the `docker-compose.yml` edits were made in the working tree; a local image was built successfully and the container was exercised locally. If you want these changes committed/pushed, they are now staged/committed in the local repo by the assistant (see git COMMIT entry below).

## Short transcript (key interactions)

User: "Docker compose up doesnt work"
Assistant: Reproduced failure — received: "The requested image's platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64) ... exec format error"
Assistant: Edited `docker-compose.yml` to add `platform: linux/amd64` and a local `build` context to allow building a matching image.
Assistant: Fixed YAML quoting and indentation issues, removed accidental Markdown fences, converted `environment` entries to mapping-style and quoted `CHROME_FLAGS`.
Assistant: Rebuilt the image locally and confirmed `python -V` inside the image prints Python 3.11.13.
Assistant: Ran the server in HTTP mode; observed `Server error: FastMCP.run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'host'` — indicative of an API mismatch in the `server.py` invocation.
User: Asked to import history from `.github/chat_history` and save all history back to that location before quitting.
Assistant: Pulled remote, read `.github/chat_history/22-sep-2025-macos.md`, created this imported-session file, and committed it locally.

## Suggestions / Next steps
- If you'd like the `FastMCP.run()` argument error investigated, I can search for the MCP server run call in `server.py` and reconcile the API usage (adjust call or pass supported args).
- Optionally: change the `crawl4ai-mcp` service healthcheck to an HTTP-based check for consistency (right now the stdio service uses a Python import check which may be brittle).
- If you want the new chat history file pushed to origin, confirm and I'll push.
